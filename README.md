# Color Generator App

The Color Generator App is a React project that allows you to generate shades and tints of a chosen color. You can either input a specific hex value of a color or use the built-in color picker to select your desired color. The app then generates a range of shades and tints based on the selected color.

## Libraries Used

The Color Generator App utilizes the following libraries:

1. **values.js**: This library is used to generate shades and tints of colors. It allows the app to calculate a range of colors that are lighter or darker than the original color.

2. **react-toastify**: This library is employed to display toast notifications. Toast notifications provide feedback to the user when they perform actions such as copying a color's hex value. It enhances the user experience by providing unobtrusive notifications.
